Sundry: _adjective: of various kinds; several_

# Sundry widgets and utils

This contains a collection of Typescript and React components and other utils that I've found useful across multiple projects.

whenever I start a new project I always seem to need something that I've created in a prior project. Rather than copy the file(s) into the newer project I copy them into this library and maintain it here.

## Features

-   Bootstrap/Yup/formik styled form inputs

## Disclaimer

Anyone is welcome to use the files in this repo, but they're not super well documented. Typescript types help with this somewhat, but you should be prepared to read the source to understand how they work.

I'm happy to answer questions and accept PRs to make it better.
